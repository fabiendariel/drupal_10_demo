# CKEditor 5 Icons

This is a fast and native Font Awesome icon picker for CKEditor 5,
 built using CKEditor 5's modern TypeScript APIs.
 It enables browsing, searching for, and and selecting icons
without ever leaving the editor, and changing attributes 
such as size and style after an icon is inserted
 from a convenient widget toolbar.
