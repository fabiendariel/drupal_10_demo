 * @{
 * This module will give you a brief demonstration of how the REST service
 * works.
 *
 * This example uses nodes, because they works out of the box. But any entity
 * could be used.
 *
 * To complete a demo, we'll need a server site, containing the nodes, and a
 * client, that sends requests to the server. The same site can very well act
 * as both client and server.
 *
 * First thing you want to do, is visit 'examples/rest-client-settings' and
 * setup what website you want to interact with. To avoid complications, and
 * minimize the chance of failure, I'll suggest that you start using the same
 * site as both server and client, using the user 1 credentials. And when you
 * have gotten the feel of how things work, try to use two separate sites, and
 * maybe another user. Please note that you need to install this module on both
 * client and server site.
 *
 * Next thing you want is to go to 'examples/rest-client-actions'. This page
 * contains a table where all the remote nodes, of the type rest_example_test,
 * will be displayed. At first there might not be any.
 *
 * From the same page you can create, edit and delete nodes on the remote site.
 *
 * The server site actually only uses the View (rest_service) and the node type
 * (rest_example_test), imported upon installation of this module. The rest of
 * the functionality comes from Drupal Core modules, like 'rest', 'basic_auth'
 * and 'hal'.
 *
 * The client part of the site uses the following classes:
 *
 *  - @see
 *    \Drupal\rest_example\Controller\RestExampleClientController::indexAction()
 *    Builds the list of nodes on the remote server.
 *
 *  - @see \Drupal\rest_example\Form\RestExampleClientSettings
 *    A form that can creates/edits nodes.
 *
 *  - @see \Drupal\rest_example\Form\RestExampleClientSettings
 *    A form used to confirm the deletion of the node.
 *
 *  - @see \Drupal\rest_example\Form\RestExampleClientSettings
 *    A form where you set up with which site you want to interact.
 *
 *  - @see \Drupal\rest_example\RestExampleClientCalls
 *    This class handles all the calls to the remote site, and returns the
 *    response back, to be processed by the requesting method.
